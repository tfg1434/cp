k > n:
    Lemma 1: At most one element will become smaller in the optimal answer
    Lemma 2: If k = n (mod 2), we can increase all elements. Otherwise, we
    decrease exactly one.

    We apply (inc, dec) operations, then increase each element at most once. We
    can swap the order of these for easier implementation
    Obviously, we want these lone increases to be k, k-1, ..., k-t

    Add k to min, k-1 to min2, ..., k-(n-(n+k) mod 2)-1 to max/max2 depend on
    parity. Then apply all remaining (inc, dec) operations to the current max.
